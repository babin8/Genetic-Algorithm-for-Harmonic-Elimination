# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Harmonic-Elimination

Tools used: Grok 3, Canva, Figma

This is a reiteration of my final project for my Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I used Grok to study the report, extract a summary of the project and write me a research paper on the topic.

**Project Title**

Optimization of Switching Angles in a Five-Level Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter Using Genetic Algorithms for Harmonic Reduction

**Summary of the Approach**

1. Theoretical Study: Learned about multilevel inverters and SHE.
2. Simulation Model Development: Built a five-level inverter model.
3. Initial Simulation Run: Tested with 25∘ and 70∘, THD = 27.35%.
4. SHE Equation Formulation: Set up equations to eliminate 5th and 7th harmonics.
5. Genetic Algorithm Application: Found optimal angles 36∘ and 72∘.
6. Optimized Simulation: Verified THD reduction to 21.62%.
7. Hardware Design: Selected components (MOSFETs, Arduino, etc.).
8. Hardware Assembly: Constructed the inverter.
9. Microcontroller Programming: Programmed Arduino for pulse generation.
10. Hardware Testing: Measured THD = 17.82% with optimized angles.
11. Result Comparison: Confirmed harmonic reduction and project success.
